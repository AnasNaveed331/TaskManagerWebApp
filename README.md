# Task Manager App
A simple task manager web application that allows users to add tasks, display a welcome greeting with their name, and delete tasks from the list. This app includes customizable button colors, input field styling, and a responsive user interface.

## Features
Greeting Message: Displays a personalized welcome message with the user's name upon page load.
Task Input: Allows users to input tasks and add them to the task list.
Task Deletion: Provides a delete button for each task that removes it from the list.
Input Field Styling: Changes the border color of the input field when clicked and returns to normal when it loses focus.
Button Hover Effects: Customizable hover effects for the "Add" and "Delete" buttons.
## Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for structuring the page.
CSS3: For styling the page, including task list items, buttons, and input fields.
JavaScript: For dynamic task management (adding and deleting tasks) and user interaction.
## Usage
Upon loading the page, the app will prompt the user for their name.
The user can then add tasks to the list by entering text in the input field and clicking the "Add" button or pressing Enter.
Each task will have a "Delete" button, which can be clicked to remove the task from the list.
